###  :space_invader: Tech Stack

Java: https://www.java.com/es/
Spring: https://spring.io/
Angular 13: https://angular.io/
Typescript: https://www.typescriptlang.org/
Angular Material: https://material.angular.io/
Bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/
HTML: https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/HTML
CSS: https://www.w3schools.com/css/
MySQL: https://www.mysql.com/

With Springboot to power our fullstack application, we made a responsive website to manage selection processes.

Our goal is to facilitate the hiring process of the HR department, bringing together all the roles in a single app.

This was our first project using Angular Material and it has made some tasks much easier, besides improving the loading process of the app itself.

On this project we have worked with agile development through Scrum and Kanban. We've done four sprints, dividing our user stories on each week. We are well organized and have a nice time working together as a team.

## Lessons Learned:
---

Angular helps on developing dynamic websites while working on single components and separate features at the same time! It makes the developing process easier.
We have used for the first time JWT on Angular to work on the security function (signup, login and authorizations).
